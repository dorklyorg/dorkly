# LaunchDarkly Go SDK Events Engine

[![Circle CI](https://circleci.com/gh/launchdarkly/go-sdk-events.svg?style=svg)](https://circleci.com/gh/launchdarkly/go-sdk-events) [![Documentation](https://img.shields.io/static/v1?label=go.dev&message=reference&color=00add8)](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/launchdarkly/go-sdk-events/v3)

## Overview

This repository contains the internal analytics event logic and event data model used by the [LaunchDarkly Go SDK](https://github.com/launchdarkly/go-server-sdk). It is packaged separately because it is also used by internal LaunchDarkly components. Applications using the LaunchDarkly Go SDK should not need to reference this package directly.

## Supported Go versions

This version of the project requires a Go version of 1.18 or higher.

## Learn more

Read our [documentation](http://docs.launchdarkly.com) for in-depth instructions on configuring and using LaunchDarkly. You can also head straight to the [complete reference guide for the Go SDK](http://docs.launchdarkly.com/docs/go-sdk-reference), or the [generated API documentation](https://pkg.go.dev.org/github.com/launchdarkly/go-sdk-events/v3) for this project.

We encourage pull requests and other contributions from the community. Check out our [contributing guidelines](CONTRIBUTING.md) for instructions on how to contribute to this SDK.

## About LaunchDarkly

* LaunchDarkly is a continuous delivery platform that provides feature flags as a service and allows developers to iterate quickly and safely. We allow you to easily flag your features and manage them from the LaunchDarkly dashboard.  With LaunchDarkly, you can:
    * Roll out a new feature to a subset of your users (like a group of users who opt-in to a beta tester group), gathering feedback and bug reports from real-world use cases.
    * Gradually roll out a feature to an increasing percentage of users, and track the effect that the feature has on key metrics (for instance, how likely is a user to complete a purchase if they have feature A versus feature B?).
    * Turn off a feature that you realize is causing performance problems in production, without needing to re-deploy, or even restart the application with a changed configuration file.
    * Grant access to certain features based on user attributes, like payment plan (eg: users on the ‘gold’ plan get access to more features than users in the ‘silver’ plan). Disable parts of your application to facilitate maintenance, without taking everything offline.
* LaunchDarkly provides feature flag SDKs for a wide variety of languages and technologies. Read [our documentation](https://docs.launchdarkly.com/sdk) for a complete list.
